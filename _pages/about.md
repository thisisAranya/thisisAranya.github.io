I am a recent graduate in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from BUET. My research interests lie in **machine learning**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **large language models (LLMs)**, with a strong focus on their real-world applications across diverse domains. I am passionate about leveraging AI to drive innovation and create meaningful impact at the intersection of multiple fields.

I am currently seeking **funded PhD opportunities** to advance my research and contribute to cutting-edge developments in these areas.
