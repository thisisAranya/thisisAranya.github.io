I am a recent Electrical and Electronic Engineering graduate from BUET. My research focuses on machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and large language models (LLMs), with an emphasis on their applications across various domains. I am passionate about exploring innovative ways to leverage AI for meaningful impact at the intersection of multiple fields.

I am currently looking for Funded PhD opportunities to further my research and contribute to advancements in these areas.
